# Satellite-Attitude-Control
MATLAB Simulink project
Simulates single-axis satellite attitude control in MATLAB Simulink using research paper-based parameters. Reaction wheels are modeled as DC motors with yaw angle as the control variable. Implements a tuned PID controller to stabilize and maintain a fixed yaw angle under constant disturbance torque.
